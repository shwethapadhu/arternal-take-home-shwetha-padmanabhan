# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This a simple responsive react application that can be used to track our TODO list. This application is developmed using redux, thunk middleware and material UI.
The users will be able to create and view tasks. Once the tasks are completed they can mark the task as done, which will get added to the done list.
The tasks are diplayed as cards and the number of tasks diplayed in one row varies depending upon the size of the viewing device as it is a responsive application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

To install all the dependent libraries

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
